                        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
                        objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means
                        to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
                        paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
                        using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page.
                        Other tags such as p and p surround and provide information about document text and may
                        include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the
                        content of the page.

                        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors,
                        and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
                        control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
                        formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
                        repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page

                        JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of
                        the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of
                        websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating
                        third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the
                        code on users' devices.JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
                        conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing JavaScript is a high-level, often

                        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript
                        library[3][4] for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta
                        (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[5][6][7]
                        React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with
                        frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering
                        components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other
                        client-side functionality.[8][9]?frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with

                        JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
                        Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side
                        scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic
                        web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js
                        represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a
